### Hello :fox_face:

- My name is Matt Saenz (he/him)
- I'm a software engineer at [Trailstone](https://www.trailstonegroup.com)
- Nowadays my main languages are Python :snake:, Bash, and SQL (but R was my first :heart:)
- I used to work a lot with the [Current Population Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about.html) (in case you're wondering why I wrote [cpsR](https://github.com/matt-saenz/cpsR) and [PyCPS](https://github.com/matt-saenz/PyCPS))
- :point_right: I'm deeply committed to using data and code to improve lives
- Fun fact: I'm an avid climber and former climbing instructor :climbing_man:
