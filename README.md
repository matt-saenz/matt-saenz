### Hello :fox_face:

- My name is Matt Saenz (he/him)
- I'm a data engineer on the [HealthCare.gov](https://www.healthcare.gov) team at [BlueLabs Analytics](https://bluelabs.com)
- Nowadays my main language is Python :snake: but R was my first :heart:
- I used to work a lot with the [Current Population Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about.html) (in case you're wondering why I wrote [cpsR](https://github.com/matt-saenz/cpsR))
- :point_right: I'm deeply committed to using data to improve lives
- Fun fact: I'm an avid climber and former climbing instructor :climbing_man:
